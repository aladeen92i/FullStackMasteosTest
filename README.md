# Fullstack POC for a job interview

The point was to code the functions, that i've been doing in vanilla javascript on http://zpalexander.com/you-cant-javascript-under-pressure/, in a client & a REST API.

## Made with **React.js** & **Node.js**


- just clone this repo
- run npm install in the client & server folders
- then run npm start in each folder again

You're ready to go !
